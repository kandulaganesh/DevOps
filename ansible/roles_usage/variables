1. Variables defined in vars/main.yml have high precedence.
2. Variables defined in defaults have low precedence.



Ways of defining Variables:

   1. in files (defailus/main.yml, vars/main.yml)
   2. Passing as parameter to role using vars directive

	- hosts: all
          roles:
            - role: my-role
              day_of_the_week: Monday


Variables defined in the play section using vars directive are accessable with-in the play and all components inside the play also have access i.e like roles defined play have access to those variables
