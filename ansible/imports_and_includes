imports/include


import_playbook  --> for importing the play (play level)
import_tasks   --> For importing tasks (tasks level, so in the tasks block we do)
import_role    --> Importing the role in the tasks section
    tasks_from: change the default tasks include file (default is main.yml, but load custom tasks file)



If we want to call some directive (for now include and import directive), there are two ways

    1. If we want to call the directive alone, without passing much options/parameters to the directive,

        - <directive>

        example:

            - import_playbook: <playbook-name>

            - import_tasks: <task-name>
            - roles: <role_name>

            roles:
              - role-1
              - role-2



    2. If we want to call the directive, but along with directive we want to pass options/parameters as well

            - name: Importing Playbook
              import_playbook: <playbook-name>
              vars:
                 variable1: value1

             - name: Importing Task
               import_tasks: <task-name>

               
Difference:

	All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed.
	All include* statements are processed as they encountered during the execution of the playbook.
