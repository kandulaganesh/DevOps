Inventory:

    [group_a]
    server1 ansible_host=203.0.113.111
    server2 ansible_host=203.0.113.112

    [group_b]
    server3 ansible_host=203.0.113.113
    server4 ansible_host=server_hostname

    [group_a:vars]
    ansible_user=sammy

    [group_b:vars]
    ansible_user=myuser


Ansible allows you to assign groups to other groups using the [groupname:children] syntax in the inventory. This gives you the ability to name certain groups members of other groups. Children groups have the ability to override variables set by the parent groups.
