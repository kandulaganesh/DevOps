Users:

sudo adduser testUser // For adding User, we also have "useradd" command for creating users which is same as adduser
sudo userdel testUser // For deleting User
/etc/passwd // This file contains all info abt users, and their home directories
sudo passwd testUser // Used for changing the password for a user
whoami // showing current user
su <user-name> // switching user

Groups:

sudo groupadd <group-name> // cretaing the group
sudo groupdel <group-name> // deleting the group
sudo usermod -a -G <group-name> <user-name> // adding user to group
sudo gpasswd -d <user_name> <new_group> // deleting user from group
/etc/group // Contains list of groups


Permissions:

761 -> 7 is for Owner user permission for the file, 6 -> Owner Group permission for file, 1 -> Everybody else (other than owner and group)

4 -> read
2 ->  Write
1 -> Execute
0 -> Reset/Remove the permission

To give both read and write, value is 4 + 2 = 6, so 6 is for both read and write
To give read and execute, value is 5
To give all permissions, value is 4+2+1=7

sudo chown <user> <file/folder> // Change the owner of a file or folder

sudo chown <user> <folder> -R // Change the owner for a folder and sub folders

sudo chgrp <group-name> <file/folder> // Change the group permission for a file or group 
sudo chgrp <group-name> <folder> -R // Recursively changing the group ownership for a folder and sub-folders
