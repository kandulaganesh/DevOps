Examples:

Consider a scenario where we want to send request to nginx docker container. Usually docker containers will have non-routable ip address.

Follow below steps to make container reachable to external network using iptables

Create a docker container:

	docker run -d nginx:latest

	Above command will create a docker container which will have a private ip and listens on port 80

	There are many ways to make this container reachable to external network, few are

		1. Port mapping using -p option
		2. DNAT, overwrite the packet header using iptables

	Command to change the packet header is, below command will change the destination ip and port details
		
                iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d <host-ip> --dport <availabe-host-port> -j DNAT --to-destination <ContainerIp>:80


Insertion Options:

        -I  -> Insert rule at a particular position
	-A  -> Append rule to the chain
	-D  -> Delete rule from chain
	-L  -> List the rules

	iptables -t <table-name> -I <chain-name> <position-to-insert> .......
