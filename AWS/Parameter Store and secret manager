Systems Manager:
	AWS Systems Manager is a management service that helps you automatically collect software inventory, apply OS patches, create system images, and configure Windows and Linux operating systems. These capabilities help you define and track system configurations, prevent drift, and maintain software compliance of your EC2 and on-premises configurations. By providing a management approach that is designed for the scale and agility of the cloud but extends into your on-premises data center, Systems Manager makes it easier for you to seamlessly bridge your existing infrastructure with AWS.


	How it works:

		We have to create a SystemManagers Agent on every Instance and it will connect to the SSMs service.

		We can have agent on on-premise instances as well.

		



Parameter Strore
	Vault in Cloud

	Centralized management of passwords and secrets.

	KeyValue pair

	Can encript

	Can use them EveryWhere (ssm:parameter-name)

	It allows nested keys.

	All the parameters are Versioned.

	Parameter sore is not only for secrets, but also for the configuration information...

	and we can apply that configuration to all systems.

	Parameter Store uses AWS KMS to encrypt and decrypt the parameter values of secure string parameters.



Session Manager:

	Without opening port 22 on EC2 Instances... We can use Session Manager to enter to console of EC2


Secret Manager:

	Helps in storing passwords and we can access from applications, cli and .....

	Random password generator

	Secerts auto rotation and apply those vales to RDS.

	Seceret manager -> lambda(this will rotate password) -> RDB
		CloudWatch event will trigger the lambda for rotating secrets

	Uses KMS for encripting the secrets


Above both supports API for intregration with Application.
