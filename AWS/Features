Aside of services, We have multiple features:

	1. Security Groups
	2. Elastic IP's
	3. Elastic Virtual Network Interface (ENI)
		Network Interfaces are AZ's specific. i.e we cannot assign AZ-1's ENI to AZ-2's Instance.
	4. TargetGroups
		a. Stickiness (Using cookies)
		b. This will work for CLB and ALB
		c. This may bring im-balance of traffic


	The advantage of Features is, they are not specific to any instance or service... i.e we can detach and reattach to any service at any time.



Above features are not limited to EC2 instances.. we can assign to any object.. i.e Security Groups can be assigned to ENI
