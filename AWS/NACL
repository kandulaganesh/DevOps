An Optional layer of security that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of "subnets".

NACL acts as a firewall at the subnet level.

Evaluation of rules happen based on the rule number.

In security groups everything is denied by default and we have an option of allowing the traffic, no deny option.

But here in NACL, we have both of Allow and Deny option, unlike SG where we have only allow rules.

NACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic.

NACL's are stateless. (Incoming rules will not be applied for outgoing)


NACL's are associated with the subnets.


They only work in the edges of network....

In Security Group we can give both specific ip-address or a range of ip-address, but in NACL's we have to give specific ip-address

SecurityGroup can have a specific-ipaddress or range of ip-address or another security group as source


Security Groups will analyze all the rules, i.e if any rule is ALLOW, the traffic will be directed.

NACL's will have priiorities to the rules(Less number will have high priority), Rule with high priority takes over the low priority.

Rules include only ip-address.

Can have both ALLOW and DENY Rules

Security Group can have only ALLOW Rules

By default NACL's allow both inbound and outbound rules

Security Group is statefull and NACL's are stateless

A subnet can have only one NACL's, but a NACL can be attached to many subnets
