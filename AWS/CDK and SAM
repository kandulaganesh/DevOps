Transpiler: It turns one source code to another

CDK transpiles into CloudFormation Templates


SAM:

	1. A CloudFormation MACRO
	2. An extension to CloudFormation that lets you define serverless applications.
	3. It is AWS CLI as well

	Helps in define and deploy server less applications

	CloudFormation allows us to use SAM macro using "transform" attribute

	Example:

		Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'

	SAM gives us following resource types in CloudFormation template:

		1. AWS::Serverless::Function
			Creates an AWS Lambda function, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) execution role, and event source mappings that trigger the function
		2. AWS::Serverless::API
		3. AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
