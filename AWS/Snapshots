Snapshots can be shared with other accounts by clicking add permissions in snapshot section

Snapshot of an encrypted resource is encrypted one

and Snapshot of an unencrypted resource is Unencrypted one

Snapshots are like a copy, we take backup


While creating few resources, they ask for encryption like:

	1. Volumes
		For these if volume already exists, then create a snapshot and from snapshot while creating a volume, choose enable encryption.

For other Resources like RDS, while creating snapshot only enable the encryption.

We can copy snapshot from one region to another region


Have a snapshot
Create a copy of that snapshot and while creating copy it will prompt for encryption

If the source snapshot is encrypted, the destination snapshot will always be encrypted. You can, however, choose to encrypt it with a different master key.


Visibility is region.
