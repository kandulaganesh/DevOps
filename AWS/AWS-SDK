AWS SDK is a set of API libraries, that let you integrate AWS services to your applications.


We (Here we can be human, code) can communicate with AWS Components by three ways:

	1. AWS Console
	2. AWS Commands
	3. AWS SDK


Use exponential BackOff if we get errors;

	1. 5xx server errors
	2. Throttling errors

Don't use exponential Backoff for 4xx errors

	4xx -> Client errors

	5xx -> Server errors
