CodeDeploy provides two deployment type options – in-place and blue/green. Note that AWS Lambda and Amazon ECS deployments cannot use an in-place deployment type.

“Canary” is incorrect as this is a traffic shifting option, not a deployment type. Traffic is shifted in two increments.

“Linear” is incorrect as this is a traffic shifting option, not a deployment type. Traffic is shifted in two increments.


“In-place” is incorrect as AWS Lambda and Amazon ECS deployments cannot use an in-place deployment type.



To Deploy applications on EC2 or On Premise through CloudDeploy, we must have an agent on these machines

agent will continously poll the CodeDeploy and check for the new changes and based on it it will take the action.

CodeDeploy will send the appspec.yml file and it will pull code from the source code

appspec.yml which will present at root of source code, will helps in deploying the application

CodeDeploy, Blue/Green only works with EC2 instances (not in on-premise)

CodeDeploy do not provision resources, We have to create resources. (It assumes EC2 already running)


CodeDeploy Detect the targets by

	1. EC2 instances using Tags
	2. ASG Directly

Failed instances will stay in failure state, new deployments will triggered in Failed Instances first


In CodeDeploy we have two deployment strategies/types

	1. In-place
	2. Blue/green

To use CodeDeploy, we have to install CodeDeploy agent on instances (Doesn't matter on-premise or AWS resources)

if a rollback happens, CodeDeploy redeploys the last known good revision as a new deployment
