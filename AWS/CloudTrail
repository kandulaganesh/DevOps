Logs API calls between services.

When we want to know whom to blame.

Used to monitor api calls and actions made on an AWS account.

It enables governance, compliance, operational auditing and risk auditing

Like when something went wrong .. we can get when.. whom.. who... all these details can be captured

With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.

CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services


We can send cloudTrails events to CloudWatch logs...

By default event history keeps 90Days events


We can create as many cloudtrails as we can... it will manage two events.. 

	1. Management events
		Logs of actions on all AWS Resources.. in u r AWS Account
	2. Data events
		Logs of S3 and Lambda.. (Frequently used resources)
		like uploading.. deleting the data in S3
		Invoking lambda comes under Data events
		For now Data events supports only S3 and Lambda
	3. Insight Events
		Keep Track of any suspicious activities happening on account


CloudTrails have too many logs.. it's tough to analyze and monitor the logs.. we AWS Provides Anthena helps in using, managing and monitoring the CloudTrail Logs easily.


When u need to know whom to blame.. Just goto CloudTrail



By Default event history will track all the events that are happening on this account for 90 Days..


If we want to all events more than 90Days and also stream them to s3 bucket.. then we use Trail.


CloudTrail will be enabled by default.


Monitor all API call made by:

	1. SDK
	2. CLI
	3. Console

CloudTrail Events:

	1. Management Events
	2. Data Events


Management Events:

	like create delete PUT .... (Mostly all)

Data Events:

	Get request to S3 Objects, we do this operation very frequently, so don't want to mess up


Insight Events:

	Will analyze the events and check if any behaviour is anomalous.

Retention period for CloudTrail events are 90Days, if we want to store them beyond, then have to use S3 and Athena

Create a Trail for
	Insight events
	Data Events
	Management events

	and we can redirect logs to S3
