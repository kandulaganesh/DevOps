It is a fully managed

Buildspec.yml

We can encrypt the artifacts using KMS


Code Build can be done from CodePipeline or CodeBuild

CodeBuild runs on docker containers


 CodeCommit will automatically trigger the Pipeline through CloudWatch

 buildspec.yml file is consumed by CodeBuild, not any other service like CodePipeline or CodeDeploy

 CodeCommit
 CodePipeline ()
 CodeBuild
 CodeDeploy


 Basically pipeline will trigger it, but it will not pass any information to it, Pipeline knows which object to be trigerred, and it will just trigger, Object is already having all info



In pipeline, we will mention all Build and Deploy

In pipeline we mention how we want to trigger this (By polling or Cloudwatch)


Basically,

	Pipeline is a automation server which automates build,test,deploy,....

	So we have components for code,build, deploy... and we use automation server (pipelines) for automating these by triggering then when we commit

	How ?

	We configure in Pipelines, when we commit, Cloudwatch will trigger the Pipelines.

	All the stages in the Pipeline (build, deploy) will be automatically trigerred

	Build we have codeBuild, we give code commit repo, branch and code will have buildspec.yml, using this yml codeBuild will build the code

	Deploy will be trigerred by pipeline, in deploy we mention where we want to deploy (Platform) 

	CodeBuild resources will scale automatically... no provisioning

CodeBuild in VPC:

	By default CodeBuild containers are launched outside of VPC, so It cannot access the VPC Resources

	But if needed we can mention the VPC details like id, security groups, Subnet ID's ..., so the CodeBuild will get deployed in VPC and it can access the VPC Resources.
