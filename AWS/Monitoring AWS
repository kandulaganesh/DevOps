AWS Cloudwatch:

	Metrics
	Events
	Logs
	Alarms

AWS X-Ray:

	Troubleshoot Application performance and errors
	Distributed tracing of microservices

AWS CloudTrail

	Monitoring of all API Calls


By default we get EC2 Instance metrics every 5min

But with "detailed monitoring" we can get the metrics every 1min

EC2 memory usage by default is not pushed, if we want to do that we have to use custom metric

CoustomMetrics:

	1. Like Dimensions of Instances
		a. InstanceId


High Resolution 

	We can get Metrics every 1 second

	API Call parameter to enable the HighResolution is "StorageResolution"


API Call we use for posting Metrics is "PutMetricData"

Use exponential backoff in case of throttle errors

GroupMetrics:
	When you enable Auto Scaling group metrics, your Auto Scaling group sends sampled data to CloudWatch every minute. There is no charge for enabling these metrics.


An Alarm on a High Resolution Metric can be triggered as often as 10sec


CloudWatch Logs never expire
